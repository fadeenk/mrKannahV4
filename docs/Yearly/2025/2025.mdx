## Big goals achieved this year

None ðŸ˜…

## Goals NOT achieved this year

### Sell CourseKey

### Find a life partner

## Goals with some progress

### Travel to the six continents (excluding Antarctica ðŸ¥¶)

This year I have added Australia to the list. I have technically been to Europe and Asia (Middle east) but I wont count those sicne I didn't really get to explore them properly. As of North America, I have explored parts of the US and Mexico. The rest of the continents are still on my list to visit.

## Projects

### [MeetingHero.ai](https://meetinghero.ai/)

I launched it this year after creating and polishing the beta then rewriting the frontend to be more user friendly and intuitive. I also added a few new features and improved the overall user experience. I tried my best and even did a relaunch campaign and marketing to get more users. However, in the end it didn't really take off and I had to sunset it.

I presented it at TechAlley demo, that got me a single user that ended up becoming a paying customer for a few months. I created multiple videos, some blog posts, redesigned the whole website, offered free tools and trial. That didnt really get me any more users. In the end, after months of trying to aquire users, I only had 3 users that were paying and didnt churn plus Luke who has been my tester since day one.

Eventually, it didnt workout but I learned alot and I got to play around with AI and got a taste of what it takes to try to force a product market fit. The fun part is I got to document the process and the journey.

I even built a nice product updates page to keep track of all the changes and improvements I made (after the first launch in March). You can view it [here](https://app.meetinghero.ai/updates).

### Sister's engagement and wedding preparation!

Another sister got engaged and we started preparing for the wedding. It was a lot of work and I was glad to be part of it. Dress shopping, venue prep, booking singers, dj and so on... And this time I got to paint thier bedroom!

TODO: Add picutres

### Duolingo

Since I had a trip coming up to dominican republic, I decided to start using Duolingo to learn and referesh my spanish. I have been makings some good progress. I will probably keep going with it and see how far/good I get with it.

TODO: add picture of streak

### Habibi Match

After exhausting my network of people I know. I decided to give Habibi Match a try. I got matched in June with someone who seemed great on the first date, we ended up extending and having dinner that same day! However, the next date/day things took a turn and we didnt end up working out.

TODO: add more details about the match and the experience.

### DMV chaos

My parents and I swapped cars because of my dad's back condition got worse and he can no longer drive the sport car. With that I had to do a few DMV updates and fixes including paying off the car, transfering title and requesting new placards for my Dad.

### Car enhancements

Since I got my dad's car, I decided to upgrade it a bit. I added interior lights and led strips. I also added, a wireless chargers and installed a usb c port as an auxulariy port so there are no cables hanging all over the place. Finally, I installed a custom Andorid device that connects to the car's infotainment system and allows me to do wireless Android eventhough that my car doesn't support it.

### Cellphone's shinanigans!

First, I had to change my plan since I was on CourseKey's plan. The transition was rough because once I was off the plan Verizon wouldn't help me! My phone kept showing errors and I couldnt use visualmail (see voicemails in app) because it is a different network and the phone was locked to Verizon.

Eventually, I flashed my phone (reset everything and use a clean firmware not linked to any specific company) and had to set everything up again. Restoring things went smoothly for the most part, since I had everything backed up before flashing my phone. However, as I was restoring everything, I realized the whatsup messages didnt backup and everything I had in whatsapp was lost.

The phone also gave a bit of scare, when I gave it a nice dip in the ocean in the Dominican republic. The phone is water proof however since it is saltwater, the usb port got cloged with salt and I couldnt charge my phone anymore! The following day I had to take my flight back and I couldn't find a wireless charger ðŸ˜… So me and my friend gave my phone a nice water bath and brushed its port then dried it up and let it sit overnight. Thankfully it worked and I was able to charge my phone again in the morning before my flight!

Finally, my mom's phone took a swim in the pool and the screen was damaged. I was busy with ton of things and my mom needed her phone as soon as possible. So I bought a new phone and gave her my old phone. With the new phone, I had to redo the data migration and transfer everything again but this time I made sure to transfer whatsapp messages properly!

### Parents's Health and Doctors

A big chunck of this year was spent on my parents' health and doctors. That meant finding new doctors, getting them appointments, and making sure they are getting the care they need. Especially since my dad was diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's disease.

### Fleeter

A fun small project for my friend who is a truck driver. He needed a better way to find loads from Amazon Relay platform, so I built him a custom script that increases the frequency of checking for loads and it automatically notifies him when a new load is available by playing a sound. This allows him to multitask and let the script do its thing and just look at when he hears the notification sound!

### Travel Trips planning!

#### Punta Cana (Dominican Republic)

This trip was the easiest to plan! I only had to coordinate and plan the Miami trip after it and book flights/hotel. Originally, I wanted to do Mexico andSouth America as well but since MeetingHero.ai wasn't working out as expected. I decided to save up the money and just do Punta Cana and Miami. The Miami part, I didnt need to plan or do anything for it since Luke and Mallory took care of everything for me and hosted me at thier place! The trip was a blast and I got to relax and recharge!

#### [Europe trip](https://wanderlog.com/view/cjxoehlkhi/trip-to-london/shared)

The craziest trip I have planned so far! I spent months planning this trip and it was a blast! This trip was originally not planned, since it was supposed to be my sister's honeymoon trip. However, my sister and her husdband decided to include me and my parents in the trip! Making me thier tour guide and planner! We decided on a 12 days European cruise and an extra day in London. I was in charge of figuring out transportation, hotels and ensuring we do everything my sister and her husband wanted to do and not missing the ship! We ended up visiting London (UK), Edinburgh (Scotland), Invergordon & Dunrobin (Scotland), Portree (Scotland), Dublin (Ireland), and Belfast (Northern Ireland), Zaanse Schans & Amsterdam (Netherlands), Brugge (Belgium) and finally Paris (France).

## Podcasts

I added The Diary Of A CEO based on a friend's recommendation and I have been in love with it. It has a huge amount of varaity of topics and they are always interesting.
Other than that there hasn't been any changes to the [list](/blog/yearly-recap-2021#podcasts).

## Workouts

## Financial state

This year was a bit of a setback on my financial state. Since I stepped away from CourseKey, I lost my options/shares which impacted my networth. Knowing that I was transitioning, I increased my emergency fund savings to ensure I have enough saved to not stress about things. I made sure I have enough saved to find something new and not rush into something isnt for me. Also I spend alot on a big family trip.

Was an interesting month! It was a busy month with family chaos and preparations. I did my sister's photoshoot in Valley of Fire before the engagement. Then we had the engagement party and helped with the love story photoshoot. After that, I had the ASD Market Week convention which was a lot of fun and I found my new favorite perfume! As soon as the convention was over, I had another party this time it was a baptism party. Followed by more errands and family chores (moving things, fixing stuff and painting my sister's future bedroom). Finally, celebrated my other sister's baby shower and found out the gender of the baby!

### May

Was a heads down month! Between working on and updating MeetingHero and sister's wedding preparations and my upcoming trip to Punta Cana, I was busy! I did more photoshoots for my sister and her "propsal" photoshoot. I also had a friend visit and spend some time together and saw carrot top. Before heading to Punta Cana, I stopped by San Diego since my last visit was super quick and didnt get to see/spend time with friends. I also squeezed in a dental visit south the border in Mexico. I then picked up my friend from San Diego and got back to Las Vegas to head to Punta Cana!

### June

I continued to enjoy my time in Punta Cana and had a great time! However, my trip was not just all fun, I had some work stuff to take care of for MeetingHero. As soon as, my trip was over, I went to Miami to see Luke and Mallory and had a great time! I got to work from Atomic and meet his fiance and her family which was great! After that it was back to Las Vegas and back wedding preparations and work! We had my sister's bachelorette party. Then my highschool friend visited town and we spend some time together! Also, my great aunt visted as well all the way from Iraq, so spent some time showing her around and celebrated my birthday with her! Then I wrapped up the month by attending Shakira's concert!
