## Big goals achieved this year

None ðŸ˜…

## Goals NOT achieved this year

### Sell CourseKey

### Find a life partner

## Goals with some progress

### Travel to the six continents (excluding Antarctica ðŸ¥¶)

This year I have added Australia to the list. I have technically been to Europe and Asia (Middle east) but I wont count those sicne I didn't really get to explore them properly. As of North America, I have explored parts of the US and Mexico. The rest of the continents are still on my list to visit.

## Projects

## Podcasts

I added The Diary Of A CEO based on a friend's recommendation and I have been in love with it. It has a huge amount of varaity of topics and they are always interesting.
Other than that there hasn't been any changes to the [list](/blog/yearly-recap-2021#podcasts).

## Workouts

## Financial state

This year was a bit of a setback on my financial state. Since I stepped away from CourseKey, I lost my options/shares which impacted my networth. Knowing that I was transitioning, I increased my emergency fund savings to ensure I have enough saved to not stress about things. I made sure I have enough saved to find something new and not rush into something isnt for me. Also I spend alot on a big family trip.

## Month by month highlights

### January

The year was off to a good start this time! My friend was in town and we both had tickets for CES. We got to see some fun and crazy innovations in the tech world. I also got be a toursit in vegas and enjoyed the city. I even got to see Delta's keynote and a mini Lenny Kravitz concert for free at the Sphere! Then wrapped up CES with seeing Kaskade at Zouk.

And before the month ended, I made a few new friends and I joined the circus! Just kidding, I didn't join the circus, but I did go to the circus gym and started learning how to jump on the trampoline.
