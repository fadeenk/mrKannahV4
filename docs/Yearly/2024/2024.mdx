{/* ## Introduction */}

{/* <Gallery photos={[fun202349, fun202350]} /> */}

## Big goals achieved this year

None ðŸ˜…

## Goals NOT achieved this year

### Sell CourseKey

Since the year before and throughout the whole year we were working on selling CourseKey. We had a few offers but none of them were good enough to accept. We were close to accepting one but the buyer backed out last minute. After that I decided it was time for me to move on.

### Find a life partner

I have been trying to find a life partner for a while now. I have been using dating apps and going on dates but I have not been able to find the one. I have been trying to meet people through friends and family but that hasn't been successful either. I did meet incredible women but none of them were the one. Things didn't workout for one reason or another.

I did take a break from dating for a few months (May-September) to focus on myself and my projects. I resumed dating in October but nothing serious came out of. I am still on the lookout and hoping to find the one! I am also in no rush, I rather wait to find the one than rush into something that isn't right for me.

## Goals with some progress

### Travel to the six continents

This year I have added Australia to the list. I have technically been to Europe and Asia (Middle east) but I wont count those. As of North America, I have explored parts of the US and Mexico. The rest of the continents are still on my list to visit.

## Projects

### Custom Local LLMs (Large language models)

Although ChatGPT is great at many things, it is not perfect. It is not able to understand the context of the conversation and provide a relevant response. This is where custom local LLMs come in. These are models that are trained on a specific dataset and are able to provide more relevant responses. There are many opensource models that can be used. To run those models I used [Oobabooga webui](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui) and I connected it to [SillyTavern](https://sillytavernai.com/) which allows me to have multiple "characters" with specific personalities and specific skills.
![My SillyTavern](./images/SillyTavern.png)

### Class Tutor

As I continued to play around with the local LLMs, I wanted to see if I could use them within any application. So I cheated a bit and integrated it with CourseKey's frontend. I basically created a writing tutor AI chat bot that can help and provide feedback for any writing assignment. The AI is able to provide feedback on grammar, punctuation, sentence structure and more importantly things to consider to improve your writing.
![Class Tutor](./images/tutor.png)

### Private GPT

Although the local LLMs are great, they are not perfect. They are not able to give me specific information or based on sources. However, there is a tool that allows me to feed the model my own data and files and have it generate responses based on that.
![Private GPT](./images/privateGPT.png)

### AI song covers

I trained an AI model to understand my voice and use the model to convert any audio to be me speaking it. This was a fun project where I finally got to make some music covers without actually singing them. I used this [YouTube tutorial](https://youtu.be/IqraHS5sgOU?si=SARaBLRsKclWPati) to get it up and running.

<audio controls src={song}></audio>

### Upgraded Patent Prints

I have had my patents for a few years and I have been looking at them way more as I take care of my plants. So I decided to design and print a nicer poster.

![Sound Patent](./images/SoundPatent.jpg)

### Personal Website Redesign/Rewrite

My website was so outdated that when I decided to update it and add to it, I realized that I needed to rewrite the whole thing. I decided to use [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) to make it easier to maintain and update. I also added a few more features like a gallery and a password protected sections/pages. I upgraded my [virtual business card](https://mrkannah.com/card) and added a showcase section to show off some of my projects. I even created a [Dating profile](https://mrkannah.com/datingProfile) to see if it would help get me some dates.

### [PureFrame](https://pureframe.app/)

My friend asked me for help him with his project. I wanted to try something new, different and challenging. So I took on the project and build a desktop application that runs AI locally.

It uses multiple technologies and languages. I used Vue for the frontend, Python, Node and Electron for the backend. You can view the app and what it does [here](https://pureframe.app/).

### Cloud Services (WIP)

Rebuild my cloud services to be better and available from anywhere. Additionally, I have added a few new services but have not managed to finish setting them up. I did set up intrusion detection and intrusion prevention systems. I also experimented with running my own password manager vault, a few monitoring tools and a remote desktop service.

Sadly, I haven't been able to finish setting up the services and migrate my old cloud to the new system. I did however have to rush building and making an invoicing/billing service work so I could bill people for consulting work I did.

### [MeetingHero.ai](https://meetinghero.ai/)

I have been working on a project that helps with meetings. Since, I was no longer on CourseKey, this is my next venture. It is a tool that helps making meeting preparation much easier for you. It is still in the early stages but I have been working on it and improving it each day. By the new year, I hope to have it ready for beta testing.

## Projects that didn't go anywhere

### [Dating Profile](/datingProfile)

I created a dating profile to see if it would help me get more dates. I have been using it for a few months and I have not had any luck. I have been getting a lot of matches but none of them have been leading to any thing serious.

## Podcasts

I added The Diary Of A CEO based on a friend's recommendation and I have been in love with it. It has a huge amount of varaity of topics and they are always interesting.
Other than that there hasn't been any changes to the [list](/blog/yearly-recap-2021#podcasts).

## Workouts

<Gallery photos={[workout1, workout2, workout3, workout4]} />

## Financial state

This year was a bit of a setback on my financial state. Since I moved away from CourseKey, I lost my options/shares which impacted my networth. Knowing that I was transitioning, I increased my emergency fund savings to ensure I have enough to find something new and not rush into something isnt for me. Also I spend alot on a big family trip.

## Month by month highlights

### January

For the third year in a row, I started the year by staying up extra late to take care of some CourseKey work during off peak hours! It was supposed to be quick change, however things didn't go as planned and ended up taking a few hours. Once that was taken care of, I hoped that was the last of my troubles for the new year. Sadly, that was not the case. While I was driving on the freeway, a truck next to me dropped something that hit my car and caused some serious damage for the radiator and condenser. Although, my insurance took care of it, it was a nightmare to deal with. It also took more than a month to get it fixed and I didn't have a substitute car. However, while locked up in my house, I got to play around with AI and work on a few different projects.
![Car Damage](./images/car.jpg)

Luckily, I had a few people visit town and distract me from the car troubles. First, it was my friend and his family. I had a great time catching up with my friend and showing his family around town. We had a great time exploring the city and enjoying some great food. Then, my cousins visited and we enjoyed exploring more of the city and experiencing the tournament of kings show at Excalibur. That helped turn a rough month around and set up a better trajectory for the rest of the year.

<Gallery photos={[visit1, visit2]} />

### February

This month pretty much set the tone for the year. It started with attending concert for Maluma! It was a great concert we enjoyed it so much, that we started looking into what other parties/concerts we could attend for free. We started with seeing Tyga who was at Hakkasan, then got tricked into going to an "official" Bad Bunny after party at Liv. The partying was not over, since it was February, we had our church's valentine's party.

<Gallery photos={[maluma, bunny]} />

Also we had the superbowl, which meant there were a lot of things going on in Vegas. One of those things was the Paramount experience which was ton of fun with the family. The events weren't over yet, we got invited to Death by chocolate event which was a lot of fun. We also enjoyed a Kpop bazar event where there was a lot of dancing and good snacks.

<Gallery photos={[para1, para2, para3]} />

Although, I still haven't met the one, I was still on the lookout. I managed to set up a zoom date with an incredible girl who lives in San Diego for Valentine's day. We had a great time and we decided to meet up in person. Sadly things didn't work out due to the distance, but we ended up becoming close friends. I also got to present for the youth group at church and share my story and how I have been able to stay positive and keep my faith through all the challenges I have faced.

<Gallery photos={[youth1, youth2]} />

### March

Started with getting the best seats for Nascar! However, we couldn't enjoy them as much since we were hit by crazy winds and cold weather. We still had a great time but we were freezing in the process and had to call it off early. We also had a great time at the St. Patrick's day parade in town and enjoyed some great food and drinks.
![Nascar](./images/nascar.jpg)

As the weather started to get nicer, we started doing more outdoor activities. We went to the Valley of Fire! It was great to see the red rocks and enjoy the great weather. We did a few hikes while we were there. Soon after we took advantage of our national park pass, and went and explored more of the Lake Mead national park. We enjoyed some great scenic overlooks of the lake.

<Gallery photos={[fire1, fire2, fire3, fire4]} />

Also this month, there were a lot of Anime themed events. We went to Anime night mart which was great. Then we got to enjoy a fun day experiencing the Anime Las Vegas convention! Finally, we had a work conference in town which meant I got to crash the party, network with some clients, catch up with coworkers and enjoy some fun times after the conference was done. And before wrapping up the conference and the month, I took my coworker to the new adult Playground in Vegas, where we had some fun and going down a slide and played some games.

<Gallery photos={[anime1, anime2]} />

### April

Started this month and ended with a trip to San Diego. The first trip was with the family to do our taxes. It was a quick trip and spent majority of it with relatives. The second trip was just me to hangout and catch up with friends while also taking care of some stuff.

In between the San Diego trips I had a few friends visit town and I got to do a staycation and be a tourist in my own city. We had a lot of fun, including going shooting in a range here locally and my favorite arcade.

I also started doing Acupuncture at the recommendation of a friend. I was skeptical at first but I have been enjoying it and it has been helping me relax, sleep better and just reduce some of the pain I got by injuring myself.

My last trip of the month to San Diego was very eventful, got to catch up with a lot of highschool friends, meet up with my coworkers! Celebrate my friend's birthday and my cousin's son's birthday. Also, this trip included a date at San Diego State University, and another in Los Angeles area. Although, neither dates worked out, I still had a great time and made some great memories.

Before the month ended, I DJed and partied at a friend's son's and daughter's communion party. It was a great time and I got to DJ next to a singer/band for the first time!

<Gallery photos={[april1, april2, april3, april4, april5]} />

### May

Was an interesting month, since it was start of the summer and I was living in Vegas, I decided to checkout some of the beach clubs and night clubs in town. I got to listen to Tiesto Live and enjoy Trey Songs and Jeremih which brought back bunch of memories from when I was in highschool!

It wasn't just partying, I attended UNLV innovation day, the Tech Alley and a white labeling expo. Also got to party up at a locals club with a friend and made some new friends. Finally wrapped up the month with a SAW escape room experience which was a lot of fun and a great way to end the month.

<Gallery photos={[may1, may2, may3, may4, may5]} />

### June

This month was ton of fun! Started by checking out the new Particle Ink experience. Then had a friend's wedding in San Diego which meant another trip. This time it was a bit longer which meant I could spend more time with friends one on one vs rushing and meeting everyone at once.

Then it was my birthday which I got to celebrate it twice! The first time was just enjoying my day by going to my favorite arcade and followed it up with my favorite burger place. The second time was going to a Japanese Wagyu BBQ place with the family and enjoyed an amazing meal!

Since it was summer and getting pretty hot, we went to the water park to cool off and enjoy some water slides. And wrapped up the month with a few friends birthdays doing karaoke and some drinking.

### July

Started with celebrating my sister's birthday! Which involved lots of food and fun. We went to the new Play at Luxor and did a road trip to Mesquite. We enjoyed a few restaurants and explored the Donkey History Museum.

I had a friend and his family visit town and we had a great time. I took them to my favorite spots and we toured the strip which was ton of fun.

<Gallery photos={[july1, july2, july3, july4, july5, july6, july7]} />

### August

Was an eventful month to say the least. It started with the St. Peter Eparchy Youth Convention at Palomar Christian Conference Center. It was a great time and I got to disconnect for a bit which was nice and I got to reflect on my 10 years journey at CourseKey. I made the decision that it was time for me to step away and take the leap and try something different.

I spent the rest of the month wrapping up my projects and making sure everything was in order before I left. My goal was to have everything handed over before my second trip of the month to Arizona. I went to Arizona and got to catch up with a few friends and have great food and time. I also explored some of the museums and the zoo in the area.

<Gallery photos={[arizona1, arizona2, arizona3, arizona4, arizona5]} />

### September

Since I no longer had the massive responsibilities at CourseKey, I spent this month catching up with friends. I went to a few events and a couple of trips. First, I went to printing EXPO which was ton of fun. After that I took a trip to San Diego to catch up with friends.

While I was in there, I enjoyed many activities. I did a retreat, went to the beach a couple of times, lots of bonfires, explored little italy crossed the border for food, attended the Chaldean festival and played soccer.

### October

Another eventful month! Started with another trip to San Diego this time for Suryoyo day and Anaheim Electronics and Manufacturing show. In the process got to hangout with more friends and enjoy great food. I also stopped by the La Mesa Octoberfest and crossed the border to get some great Tacos and party a bit. Soon after I got back home, I went on another trip to San Diego this time with the family!

<Gallery photos={[oct1, oct2, oct3, oct4, oct5]} />

As soon as I got back, I volunteered at Startup Week Las Vegas. That was fun and got to meeting a few interesting people. Before Startup week was over, I went to the Small business expo. Things didn't slow down at all! I did the TechAlley and made an awesome friend. After that My sisters and I did a smash room which was ton of fun and volunteered at the Barn Buddies Harvest Festival. To wrap up the month, we enjoyed a Halloween party at church. And the last few days were spent packing up for our trip to Australia.

### November

We arrived to a massive welcome by most of our relatives in Sydney! I saw my uncle who I haven't seen in 15 years! I finally met my cousins and got to enjoy great time with relatives. I attended my cousin's communion party. The trip included enjoying great food and exploring parts of the city. We stayed in Fairfield but explored city center downtown, Chinatown and Bondi before going on our cruise to New Zealand.

Our cruise took us all around New Zealand. We started with Bay of Islands (Paihia), then Auckland, Tauranga, Christchurch, Dunedin, Dusky Sound, Doubtful Sound, and Milford Sound before going back to Sydney. During our stop in Auckland, I got to meet my uncle who I have never seen before in person! We enjoyed a lot of great food, shows and activities on the ship. We explored the cities we docked at and got to relax a bit.

Our stay back in Sedney didn't last long, we went to Gold Coast. As soon as we arrived, we started our fun adventures. During the day we explored the theme parks and after we explored the city and what it has to offer. We started by going to SeaWorld. The next day, we did Dreamworld followed by Warner Bro. Movie World. For our last day in the Gold Coast, we went to Australian outback spectacular. I got to pet a kangaroo as well as taste it.

After returning to Sedney, we had a short time to pack and head back home. While I was on the cruise, I had already booked a flight to San Diego for a date the first weekend I am back. I ended the month in San Diego attending youth group thanks giving dinner, hanging out with friends and seeing one of my best friend's new born baby girl.

### December

Continuing the theme of partying and it being December, that means we get to enjoy Christmas! I started the month by attending our church's Christmas party which was ton of fun. I also got to enjoy tree lighting and drone show. My family and I explored the Colors of Mexico. Enjoyed the Tournament of Kings (Christmas edition). Watched Sonic 3 and attended TechAlley Henderson and Las Vegas. This is all before Christmas! The day before Christmas, we celebrated Christmas at my sister's inlaws. Christmas eve we celebrated at our other church. And the same thing happened for New years eve. We celebrated at our house the day before and at church on New years eve where I was the DJ.
