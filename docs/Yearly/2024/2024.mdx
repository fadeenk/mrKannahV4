## Projects

### Custom Local LLMs (Large language models)

Although ChatGPT is great at many things, it is not perfect. It is not able to understand the context of the conversation and provide a relevant response. This is where custom local LLMs come in. These are models that are trained on a specific dataset and are able to provide more relevant responses. There are many opensource models that can be used. To run those models I used [Oobabooga webui](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui) and I connected it to [SillyTavern](https://sillytavernai.com/) which allows me to have multiple "characters" with specific personalities and specific skills.

### Class Tutor

As I continued to play around with the local LLMs, I wanted to see if I could use them within any application. So I cheated a bit and integrated it with CourseKey's frontend. I basically created a writing tutor AI chat bot that can help and provide feedback for any writing assignment. The AI is able to provide feedback on grammar, punctuation, sentence structure and more importantly things to consider to improve your writing.

### Private GPT

Although the local LLMs are great, they are not perfect. They are not able to give me specific information or based on sources. However, there is a tool that allows me to feed the model my own data and files and have it generate responses based on that.

### AI song covers

I trained an AI model to understand my voice and use the model to convert any audio to be me speaking it. This was a fun project where I finally got to make some music covers without actually singing them. I used this [YouTube tutorial](https://youtu.be/IqraHS5sgOU?si=SARaBLRsKclWPati) to get it up and running.

### Upgraded Patent Prints

I have had my patents for a few years and I have been looking at them way more as I take care of my plants. So I decided to design and print a nicer poster.

### Personal Website Redesign/Rewrite

My website was so outdated that when I decided to update it and add to it, I realized that I needed to rewrite the whole thing. I decided to use [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) to make it easier to maintain and update. I also added a few more features like a gallery and a password protected sections/pages. I upgraded my [virtual business card](https://mrkannah.com/card) and added a showcase section to show off some of my projects.

{/* ## Podcasts */}

{/* There haven't been any changes to the [list](/blog/yearly-recap-2021#podcasts). I am barely keeping up with the podcasts, that's mainly due to the lack of a commute. However, I have been listening to some podcasts during my workouts. Listening during workouts however is a bit challenging since sometimes I focus on counting and miss what the podcast said or vice versa and forget my counting. */}
